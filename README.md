## "Hotels&Co" Platform Revamp Strategy

Creating a front-end application for a legacy platform involves careful planning and strategy. Below is a step-by-step guide on how I would approach this project.

### Step 1: Initial Planning

1. **Project Kick-off:**
   - Gathering my tech team, including front-end and back-end engineers, UI/UX designers, product owners, and a scrum master.
   - Involving the business team to understand the requirements and objectives clearly.

2. **Understanding the Legacy Application:**
   - Performing a comprehensive analysis of the existing "Hotels&Co" legacy application, including its features, architecture, and weaknesses.

3. **Requirements Gathering:**
   - Collaborating with the business team to define the specific requirements for the new front-end application.
   - Identifying key user stories and acceptance criteria.

4. **Stack Selection:**
   - Choosing a modern stack for the rebuild. Eg. Next.js, React-query, Tailwind CSS, and React Testing Library.

5. **High-Level Architecture:**
   - Defining the high-level architecture of the new front-end application, considering scalability, performance, and maintainability.

### Step 2: Project Setup

6. **Git Repository Setup:**
   - Creating a Git repository to manage the project's source code.

7. **Environment Setup:**
   - Setting up development environments for all team members.
   - Ensuring that everyone on the team has access to the necessary tools and libraries.

8. **Design Collaboration:**
   - Working closely with UI/UX designers to create mockups and design guidelines.

9. **Project Structure:**
   - Creating a well-organized project structure, with clear separation of concerns (components, pages, services, etc.).
   - Defining coding standards and guidelines for the team.

### Step 3: Front-end Development

10. **App Development:**
    - Implementing the platform features as per user stories.
    - Identifying opportunities for creating reusable UI components to enhance maintainability.
    
11. **Testing:**
    - Writing unit tests for components and integration tests for key user flows.

12. **Code Review:**
    - Conducting thorough code reviews to ensure code quality, simplicity, and maintainability.

13. **Performance Optimization:**
    - Optimizing the application for low internet speeds.
    - Using code-splitting and lazy loading for faster initial page load times.
    - Implementing image optimization.

14. **Accessibility:**
    - Ensuring that the application is accessible for all users, adhering to WCAG guidelines.

15. **Quality Assurance (QA):**
    - Engaging QA testers to perform comprehensive testing, including functional, performance, and user experience testing.
    - Addressing any issues or bugs identified during the QA phase.

### Step 4: Deployment and Go-live

16. **Staging Environment:**
    - Setting up a staging environment for final testing and review.
    
17. **Deployment:**
    - Deploying the application to production servers.

18. **Monitoring and Feedback:**
    - Implementing monitoring and feedback mechanisms to track user behavior and application performance post-launch.

19. **Go-live:**
    - Officially launching the new "Hotels&Co" application.
